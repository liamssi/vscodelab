# VSCODELAB
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on [Goolge Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/).
## WHAT IS THIS ?!
A jupyter notebook to help you host your own VS CODE web dev envirement on Google Colabs.
## WHY ?!
You may use this as a free flixible altenative to other existing solution such as [Goitpod](https://gitpod.io/), [CodesanDbox](http://codesandbox.io/) that provide in browser dev envirements.
## HOW DOES IT WORK ?!
The idea is simple, and can be resumed in these following points:
* Install [VS CODE SERVER](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) on a Google colab instance.
* Expose the code server to the internet using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
## HOW TO USE THIS ?!
All you need to do to get going is to:
* Import this *Notebook* to yout [Google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) account.
* Set some basic configuration found at the top of the Notebook and run the Notebook(see screenshot 01).

**note: you can find the public URL(s) (and the Password) to your VS CODE envirement at the bottom of the Notebook (see screenshot 02)
